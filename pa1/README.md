## Sorting Algorithms
pa1 contains four implementations of sorting algorithms with c++:
1. Insertion Sort
2. Merge sort
3. Heap Sort
4. Quick Sort
## Notes:
1. To compile:
In the terminal at ./src,
make clean
make
The binary files e.g insertionSort, mergeSort, heapSort, quickSort will appear at ./src
2. To run the programs:
In the terminal:
./<xxxSort> <input file directory> <output file directory>
e.g 
```
    ./insertionSort case1.dat case1_out.dat
```
